          <h4>A. Right to Access and Review</h4>
          <p>You may request to access and review a copy of your health information. We may deny your request under certain circumstances. You will receive written notice of a denial and can appeal it. We will provide a copy of your health information in a format you request if it is readily producible.

</p>

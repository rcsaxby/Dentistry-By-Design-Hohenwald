Dr. Robinette spent his first ten years as a dentist in the United States Air Force. He was stationed at Tinker AFB, OK, Florennes AB, Belgium, Spangdahlem AB, Germany, and Nellis AFB, NV. Dr. Robinette had a very exciting and rewarding Air Force career. While stationed at Tinker AFB, he was given the opportunity to fly in AWACS and he was a member of the 1984 Air Force Bowling Championship team and a member of the 1987 Air Force Bowling Championship runner up.

While stationed at Florennes AB, Belgium he was part of the Intermediate â€“Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty to disarm mobile nuclear missiles. While at Florennes AB he was given the opportunity to enter East Germany through Check Point Charlie in West Berlin, Germany. Dr Robinette was the last person to be stationed at the dental clinic in Florennes as the base was closed as part of the INF Treaty.

He was stationed with the only mixed fighter squadron in the world while stationed at Spangdahlem AB, Germany. As part of his job at Spangdahlem AB, he routinely flew back seat in F-4 and F-16 fighters. Dr. Robinette was also in Germany when the Berlin Wall came down and East and West Germany were united as one country. Desert Shield and Desert Storm occurred while he was stationed there and his base was very active in both campaigns.

During Desert Storm Dr. Robinette was transferred to Nellis AFB, NV so that he could be a member of the dental clinic team with the Stealth Fighters at Tonopah Test Range, NV. At the time he was stationed there the Stealth Fighters were still a black operations unit.

Among the numerous awards Dr. Robinette received while stationed in the Air Force; he was the Junior Dental Officer of the Year in 1986 for the Air Force Logistics Command. He was awarded an Air Force Commendation Medal and two Air Force Meritorious Service Medals.

Dr. Robinette practices comprehensive dental care looking at the health of the oral cavity and its relationship to the overall health of the patient. He plays a strong emphasis on head and neck pain and sleep dentistry. Dr Robinette has extensive surgical skills in dental implants and periodontal therapy. Since January 2008, he has earned 1824 hours of continuing education.

In his free time, Dr. Robinette likes to bowl, snow ski, water ski, and scuba dive. He enjoys the outdoors.</p>
